    <h1>Welcome to UR Nail Boutique</h1>
    <p>
      We are <strong>@ur.nail.boutique</strong> on Instagram. You can find us at
      <a href="https://instagram.com/ur.nail.boutique" target="_blank"
        >https://instagram.com/ur.nail.boutique</a

    <h2>How We Collect Phone Numbers for SMS</h2>
    <p>
      We collect phone numbers directly through Instagram DMs during appointment
      booking conversations. Our team member will ask:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Can I get your mobile number so we can also send you an appointment
      confirmation via SMS?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>After receiving the number, we follow up with:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Thanks! Just a heads up that we’ll send your appointment time to this
      number, in addition to your calendar invite and Instagram messages.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>We also explain that this is optional and easy to stop anytime:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “If you ever want to stop receiving appointment details by SMS, just let
      us know here on Instagram or via text.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Message Frequency and Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We only send appointment-related messages.</li>
      <li>Typically, 1–2 SMS messages per appointment are sent.</li>
      <li>No promotional or marketing texts are sent at this time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Opt Out</h2>
    <p>
      Since our process is manual, clients can opt out of SMS messages at any
      time by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Messaging us on Instagram</li>
      <li>Texting us directly</li>
      <li>Informing us during any conversation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We honor all opt-out requests immediately and confirm that you won’t
      receive further SMS messages.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your phone number is only used for appointment notifications and never
      shared with third parties. For details, see our
      <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
